    "description": "Aperol Spritz is a favorite among summer season cocktails. In European resorts, it is difficult to find an institution where it is not served. The Italian (classic) version of Aperol contains 11% alcohol. The drink, made for shipments to Germany, is 4% stronger due to local legislation that requires drinks with an alcohol content of less than 15% to be bottled in refillable bottles."
